# viewing interim datasets

view_data = FALSE

# STEP 1. Downloads NYTIMES dataset ---------
# Saves nothing 
source(paste0(path_c19dashboard_repo,"/dashboard data/dd01_nytimes.R"))

# Saves urbancodes (.RDS) ---------
# No need to run dd02_urbancodes.R since it's a cross-sectional dataset 
# source(paste0(path_c19dashboard_repo,"/dashboard data/dd02_urbancodes.R")) 

# STEP 2. Saves covidtimeseries00 (.RDS) ----------
# 1. This version of covidtimeseries00 DOES NOT have the urbanization variables from dd02_urbancodes.R
# 2. The variable names are different for those ending with '_fig'
# 3. Recommendation is to retain it as such unless those variables are used elsewhere
source(paste0(path_c19dashboard_repo,"/dashboard data/dd03_covidtimeseries00.R"))

# Saves mergedsocial ---------
## dd08_mergedsocial.R pulls the relevant cross-sectional outputs and creates mergedsocial

# No need to run from dd04_ to dd08_ since they are cross-sectional datasets 
# source(paste0(path_c19dashboard_repo,"/dashboard data/dd04_acs2018_5yr.R"))
# source(paste0(path_c19dashboard_repo,"/dashboard data/dd05_svi2018_us_county.R"))
# source(paste0(path_c19dashboard_repo,"/dashboard data/dd06_CDC diabetes surveillance.R"))
# source(paste0(path_c19dashboard_repo,"/dashboard data/dd07_SAIHE.R"))
# source(paste0(path_c19dashboard_repo,"/dashboard data/dd08_mergedsocial.R"))

# STEP 3. Check if variables you need to transition from SAS to R are available

# urbancodes3.RDS gets merged only in dd13_final_merged_covidtimeseries.R
# This was done since the original R code repeats the merging step
# You might want to check if the output in covidtimeseries00.csv is the same.
